### 摘要
Lung cancer screening (LCS) reduces mortality and involves vast multimodal data such as text, tables, and images. Fully mining such big data requires multitasking; otherwise,occult but important features may be overlooked, adversely affecting clinical management and healthcare quality. Here we propose a medical multimodal-multitask foundation model (M3FM) for three dimensional low-dose computed tomography (CT) LCS. After curating a multimodal multitask dataset of 49 clinical data types, 163,725 chest CT series, and 17 tasks involved in LCS, we develop a scalable multimodal question answering model architecture for synergistic multimodal multitasking. M3FM consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models, improving lung cancer risk and cardiovascular disease mortality risk prediction by up to 20% and 10% respectively. M3FM processes multiscale high-dimensional images, handles various combinations of multimodal data, identifies informative data elements, and adapts to out-of-distribution tasks with minimal data. In this work, we show that M3FM advances various LCS tasks through large-scale multimodal and multitask learning.
